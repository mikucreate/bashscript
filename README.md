# bashscript is a way that aims to make shell scripting like bash behave like javascript. Bashscript in my ideal would work like this:



using javascript{

console.log('Hello world!');
let bashScript = 20;



console.log(bashScript);
};

basically it would allow you to install javascript into shell scripting which makes it easier for graphics and more.
